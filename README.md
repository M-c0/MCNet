# MCNet: Modality-Aware Token Filtering and Common Feature Enhancement Network

MCNet is a Transformer-based framework for **multi-modal vehicle re-identification (ReID)**, designed to address background interference and modality inconsistency in RGB, NIR, and TIR images.  
It introduces **Attention-based Spatial Token Filtering (ASTF)**, **Common Feature Extraction (CFE)**, and **Modality Enhancement (ME)** modules to achieve robust cross-modal feature learning.

## ðŸ“¦ Code Release
The full code and training scripts will be **released soon**. ðŸš€

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Transformer-based multi-modal ReID** framework.
- **ASTF**: token-level filtering to suppress background noise.  
- **CFE**: learn modality-invariant features with global contrastive and local alignment losses.  
- **ME**: selectively enhance modalities with cross-attention.  
- State-of-the-art performance on **RGBNT100** and **MSVR310** datasets.
